	<h2>1 - Introduction</h2>
	<p>Documentation for Everest is formatted in a specific way. This page explains how a page is formatted, and what certain things mean, in as much detail as possible.</p>
	<h2>2 - Cards</h2>
	<p><strong>2.1 </strong>Introduction</p>
	<p>Most Everest documentation pages will contain some type of a "card". Put simply, these are small containers that contain file contents, kernel configurations, warnings, notes, etc. There are 6 types of cards:</p>
	<p><strong>2.2 </strong>Note</p>
	<p>This card is the most simple. It contains a note on a certain section. They are usually not required to read, but contain important information.</p>
	<notehead><strong>NOTE:</strong></notehead>
	<div class="note">
		<p>This is an example of a note card.</p>
	</div>
	<p><strong>2.3 </strong>Caution</p>
	<p>This card is one step up from a note. It contains important information, and should be read. However, it usually isn't urgent, or if it is, it contains things that most would consider common knowledge.</p>
	<cautionhead><strong>CAUTION:</strong></cautionhead>
	<div class="caution">
		<p>This is an example of a caution card.</p>
	</div>
	<p><strong>2.4 </strong>Warning</p>
	<p>This card is one of the most important. It contains extremely important information that, if not understood, could lead to system breakage, data loss, etc.</p>
	<warnhead><strong>WARNING:</strong></warnhead>
	<div class="warning">
		<p>This is an example of a warning card.</p>
	</div>
	<p><strong>2.5 </strong>File</p>
	<p>This card contains the contents of a text file. It is usually used to show configuration files.</p>
	<fhead><strong>FILE:</strong> example.txt</fhead>
	<div class="file">
		<p>This is an example of a file card.</p>
	</div>
	<p><strong>2.6 </strong>Kernel</p>
	<p>This card contains a kernel configuration as seen in <cil>make menuconfig</cil>.</p>
	<khead><strong>KERNEL:</strong> Enable module "example</khead>
	<div class="kernel">
		<p>This is an example of a kernel card.</p>
	</div>
	<p><strong>2.7 </strong>Bigcode</p>
	<p>The <cil>code</cil> tag is typically used to denote commands the user should run. The <cil>bigcode</cil> card is meant for showing programs, usually Bash or Python scripts, or C programs.</p>
	<bigcodehead><strong>CODE:</strong> example.c</bigcodehead>
	<div class="bigcode">
		<p>This is an example of a bigcode card.</p>
	</div>
	<p><strong>2.8 </strong>News</p>
	<p>This card is meant for sharing news about the distribution. It is only found on the homepage.</p>
	<newshead><strong>1/1/70 - Example</strong></newshead>
	<div class="news">
		<p>This is an example of a news card.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>3 - Page Structure</h2>
	<p>Everest documentation pages are organized into:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a>Chapters</a></li>
		<li><a>Sections</a></li>
		<li><a>Subsections</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>3.1</strong> Chapters</p>
	<p>Chapters are typically the largest sections on a given page. The topics they cover are very broad. Each chapter contains its own sections.</p>
	<p>A chapter header is large, bold, has a colored sidebar, and is denoted by its number.</p>
	<p><strong>3.2</strong> Sections</p>
	<p>Sections are nested within chapters, and typically pertain to more specific topics related to a chapter.</p>
	<p>A section header is bold, and is denoted by the number of the chapter it is nested under, followed by that section's number.</p>
	<p><strong>3.3</strong> Subsections</p>
	<p>Subsections are nested within sections, and usually contain very specific topics pertaining to a section (and chapter at large). Sometimes, a page does not use subsections at all.</p>
	<p>A subsection header is italic, and is denoted by the number of the chapter it is nested under, followed by the number of the section it is nested under, followed by that subsection's number.</p>
