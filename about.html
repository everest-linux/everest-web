<h1>About Everest</h1>
<p>Everest Linux is a source based Linux distribution.</p>
<p>It is intended to function somewhat like an Arch/Gentoo hybrid</p>
<p></p>
<h3>History of Everest</h3>
<p>2021 - The idea of a system that combines the simplicity of binary packaging with the flexibility of source based packaging was born</p>
<p>Early 2022 - Early prototypes of Glacier were created. These versions came with no multi-repository support, caching, or logging of any kind</p>
<p>Mid 2022 - Glacier reaches a stable release point</p>
<p>Late June 2022 - everestlinux.org is registered and git.everestlinux.org goes online</p>
<p>September 2022 - Early prototypes of the ELIF (Everest Linux Installation Framework) are completed</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Design Principles</h3>
<p>Our design principles guide the development of Everest. You may notice we share some of these with Arch.</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong> - We provide packages with almost zero modifications from upstream, except when necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong> - Everest is designed with flexibility in mind. Any modification can be achieved if the user has enough knowledge</p>
<p><strong>User Choice</strong> - Users are free to make any choice they see fit; this includes using proprietary software through the <strong>multiverse</strong> repository.
<p><strong>User Centrality</strong> - We believe that instead of trying to cater to as many users as possible, we should only target those with interest and knowledge in Linux.</p>
