	<h2>About Everest</h2>
	<p>Everest Linux is a source based Linux meta-distribution,</p>
	<p>with a focus on simplicity and flexibility.</p>
	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>2021 - The idea of a packaging system that combined</p>
	<p>the simplicity of binary based packaging with the power of source</p>
	<p>based packaging was proposed.</p>
	<p>Early 2022 - Early prototypes of Glacier were created. These</p>
	<p>versions came with no multi-repository support, caching, or logging</p>
	<p>of any kind.</p>
	<p>Mid 2022 - Glacier v1 releases. This was the first stable release</p>
	<p>of Glacier.</p>
	<p>Early June 2022 - Glacier v2 is released.
	<p>Late June 2022 - everestlinux.org is registered.</p>
	<p>September 2022 - Different ways of bootstrapping a base system</p>
	<p>are tested by the development team.</p>
	<p>October 2022 - Glacier v3 is released.</p>
	<p>December 2022 - System image builds done by the development team.</p>
	<h2>Design Principles</h2>
	<p>Our design principles heavily influence and guide development.</p>
	<p>You may notice we share many of these with Arch.</p>
	<strong>Simplicity</strong>
	<p>We follow the UNIX philosphy when possible. Programs should do one thing,</p>
	<p>and do it right. Our packages have almost zero modifications from upstream.</p>
	<p>The base system contains only what you need to start building your system.</p>
	<p>The base Everest system also weighs in at around 100 MB</p>
	<strong>Flexibility</strong>
	<p>Everest is designed with flexibility in mind. Any modification can</p>
	<p>be achieved if the user has enough knowledge.</p>
	<p>For example, it is possible to replace Busybox with sbase, or use</p>
	<p>runit as your init system, all without breakage.</p>
	<strong>Functionality versus Ideology</strong>
	<p>The developers of Everest are strong advocates of free software, but</p>
	<p>understand that it cannot be implemented 100% of the time, such as</p>
	<p>in the form of drivers. We also understand that some users may</p>
	<p>prefer proprietary software over libre counterparts. We take</p>
	<p>no steps to prevent proprietary software in our package database,</p>
	<p>only requiring it to be under <strong>multiverse</strong>.</p>
	<p>This is a very different approach from heavily ideological distributions,</p>
	<p>some of which don't even support many packages/features many find useful.</p>
	<strong>User Centrality</strong>
	<p>We believe that instead of trying to make Everest easy</p>
	<p>to use out-of-the-box, we should instead focus on improving</p>
	<p>functionality for experienced users.</p>
