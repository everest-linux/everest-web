<h1>Everest Linux</h1>
<p>A highly flexible, general purpose operating system, built off of the Linux kernel.</p>
<h2>Why Everest?</h2>
<p><strong>Simple: </strong>Everest strives to be simple by design, coming with no pre-installed bloatware.</p>
<p><strong>Stable: </strong>Everest is designed to be as stable as possible. Adopting a unique approach to package management, update any package whenever you want, or not at all. Plus, major package dependencies are not resolved automatically, reducing the possibility of needing to downgrade a library.</p>
<p><strong>Fast: </strong>Everest compiles packages so they can run as efficiently as possible. Simply define your desired makeflags and you're ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>Lightweight: </strong>Everest uses busybox and sysvinit to provide an extremely lightweight system.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible: </strong>Everest supports higly customized installations, to the point where some of them can't even be considered Everest anymore.</p>
