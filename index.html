	<h2>Everest Linux</h2>
	<p>A highly flexible, general purpose meta-distribution, built off of the monolithic Linux kernel and Glacier package manager.</p>
	<h2>Why Everest?</h2>
	<strong>Simple: </strong><p>Everest strives to be simple by design, coming with no pre-installed bloatware or spyware. Everest follows the UNIX philosophy whenever possible,</p>
	<p>and tries to avoid including large programs in its base system.</p>
	<strong>Stable: </strong><p>Everest is designed to be as stable as possible. All base system programs are statically linked, and can be updated with git-controlled root filesystems.</p>
	<strong>Fast: </strong><p>Glacier downloads program source code and compiles it locally on your system. The end result is an extremely fast and optimized package. Simply define</p>
	<p>CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and MAKEFLAGS, and you're ready to go.</p>
	<strong>Lightweight: </strong><p>Everest uses Busybox for its userland tools and init system, and musl for its standard C library. All of these tools are designed to be as lightweight as possible.</p>
	<strong>Flexible: </strong><p>Everest supports highly customized installations. Want to replace Busybox init with systemd, openrc, runit, dinit, or s6? Or replace musl with uClibc or Glibc? All of these are</p>
	<p>possible, and encouraged.</p>
