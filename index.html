<h1>Everest Linux</h1>
<p>A highly flexible, general purpose meta-distribution, built off of the monolithic Linux kernel and Glacier package manager.</p>
<h2>Why Everest?</h2>
<p><strong>Simple: </strong>Everest strives to be simple by design, coming with no pre-installed bloatware, or spyware. Everest follows the UNIX philosphy when possible, and attempts to avoid using large GNU programs in its base system.</p>
<p><strong>Stable: </strong>Everest is designed to be as stable as possible. All base system programs are statically linked, and Glacier will not operate on packages unless you tell it to.</p>
<p><strong>Fast: </strong>Glacier downloads program source code from the Everest Package Index, then compiles it locally on your system, resulting in an extremely optimized experience. Simply define the makeflags for your system and you're ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>Lightweight: </strong>Everest uses Busybox for its userland tools and init, and musl for its C library. All of these tools are designed to be as lightweight as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible: </strong>Everest supports higly customized installations. Any part of Everest can be replaced.</p>
