	<h2>Everest Linux</h2>
	<p>A highly flexible, general purpose meta-distribution, built off of the monolithic Linux kernel and Glacier package manager.</p>
	<h2>Why Everest?</h2>
	<strong>Simple: </strong><p>Everest strives to be simple by design, coming with no pre-installed bloatware or spyware. Everest follows the UNIX philosophy whenever possible,</p>
	<p>and tries to avoid including large programs in its base system.</p>
	<strong>Stable: </strong><p>Everest is designed to be as stable as possible. All base system programs are statically linked, and can be updated with git-controlled root filesystems.</p>
	<strong>Fast: </strong><p>Glacier downloads program source code and compiles it locally on your system. The end result is an extremely fast and optimized package. Simply define</p>
	<p>CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and MAKEFLAGS, and you're ready to go.</p>
	<strong>Lightweight: </strong><p>Everest uses Busybox for its userland tools and init system, and musl for its standard C library. All of these tools are designed to be as lightweight as possible.</p>
	<strong>Flexible: </strong><p>Everest supports highly customized installations. Want to replace Busybox init with systemd, openrc, runit, dinit, or s6? Or replace musl with uClibc or Glibc? All of these are</p>
	<p>possible, and encouraged.</p>

	<h2>News</h2>
	<p>2/1/23 - Manual intervention required for /etc/glacier.conf</p>
	<p>With the new Glacier update, changes were made to the download backend. Please ensure your current configuration is overwritten while updating.</p>
	<p>----------------------------------------</p>
	<p>1/26/23 - Website overhaul</p>
	<p>The Everest website has been completely overhauled with a cleaner, sleeker look.</p>
	<p>----------------------------------------</p>
	<p>1/26/23 - System image builds nearly complete</p>
	<p>A system image is coming together. This includes the toolchain We are still ironing out issues with Busybox's wget implementation, which fails to support https.</p>
	<p>----------------------------------------</p>
	<p>11/1/22 - System image builds have begun</p>
	<p>Today, the team has begun compiling system images. All programs have compiled correctly, with the exception of the system toolchain. This is a very important component,</p>
	<p>and the system cannot function without it.</p>
	<p>----------------------------------------</p>
	<p>10/25/22 - Glacier v3 is released</p>
	<p>After nearly 2 months of hard work, Glacier v3 is finally out. This release includes many stability improvements,</p>
	<p>changes to the codebase to improve readability, and a new build system.</p>
	<p>----------------------------------------</p>
	<p>10/7/22 - Glacier v3 enters testing</p>
	<p>Glacier v3 is now available for testing. Please note that this release is not stable and therefore should not be run on a production machine.</p>
	<p>----------------------------------------</p>
	<p>8/31/22 - Announcing Glacier v3</p>
	<p>Glacier v2, which was release back in June, functions great, however does not function like a typical package manager would.</p>
	<p>Additionally, adding functionality is very difficult as the codebase is very complex and messy. Glacier v3 aims to fix these issues.</p>
	<p>----------------------------------------</p>
	<p>6/21/22 - Registering everestlinux.org</p>
	<p>Everest now owns a domain. This allows us to host our own website, rather than using GitHub (which is owned by Microsoft). This gives</p>
	<p>us more control over our work.</p>
	<p>----------------------------------------</p>
	<p>5/31/22 - Glacier v2 is released</p>
	<p>Glacier v2 has been released. This version provides several improvements to the codebase, such as compressing everything to a single executable,</p>
	<p>and removing the whole "enter package name" scheme.</p>
