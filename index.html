	<h2>Everest Linux</h2>
	<p>A highly flexible, general purpose meta-distribution, built off of the monolithic Linux kernel and Glacier package manager.</p>
	<h2>Advantages of Everest</h2>
	<strong>Simple: </strong><p>Everest strives to be simple by design, coming with no pre-installed bloatware or spyware. Everest follows the UNIX philosophy whenever possible, and tries to avoid including large programs in its base system.</p>
	<strong>Stable: </strong><p>Everest is designed to be as stable as possible. All base system programs are statically linked, and can be updated with git-controlled root filesystems.</p>
	<strong>Fast: </strong><p>Glacier downloads program source code and compiles it locally on your system. The end result is an extremely fast and optimized package. Simply define CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and MAKEFLAGS, and you're ready to go.</p>
	<strong>Lightweight: </strong><p>Everest uses Busybox for its userland tools and init system, and musl for its standard C library. All of these tools are designed to be as lightweight as possible.</p>
	<strong>Flexible: </strong><p>Everest supports highly customized installations. Want to replace Busybox init with systemd, openrc, runit, dinit, or s6? Or replace musl with uClibc or Glibc? All of these are possible, and encouraged.</p>

	<newshead><strong>12/20/23 - Everest v1.0.0 and Glacier v4.0.0 put on hold</strong></newshead>
	<div class="news">
		<p>Unfortunately, the releases scheduled for January 1st are being put on hold.</p>
		<p>The past few months have been very busy in terms of college stuff. Thankfully, I have been accepted into multiple schools and have a good idea of where I'm going.</p>
		<p>Since this stuff is clearing up, I now have more time to work on releasing Everest and Glacier. Most importantly, I now have a testbed to run everything on.</p>
		<p>The new target release date is March 1st, 2024.</p>
		<p>Once again, thank you for your continued support of this project.</p>
